# Task Manager Application
# Overview
The Task Manager Application is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using React, Redux Toolkit, Bootstrap 5.3, Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, updating the status, and deleting them. Additionally, it supports priority management through a select option and task status management similar to JIRA.

# Features
Task List: Displays tasks with their name, due date, description, status, and priority.
Task Details Page: Displays full details of the task when clicked.
Add Task: Allows users to add new tasks using a modal form.
Edit Task: Allows users to edit existing tasks and update their details.
Delete Task: Users can delete tasks from the task list.
Status Update: Allows updating of task status (To Do, In Progress, Done).
Priority Management: Users can assign priorities (Low, Medium, High) to tasks.

# Technologies Used
React: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Redux Toolkit: For state management, handling task creation, updates, and deletion.
Bootstrap 5.3: CSS framework for responsive and consistent layout design.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for quick and custom styling.
React DnD: Library for drag-and-drop interactions to manage task status updates.
React Router: For routing between the task list and task details pages.

# Usage

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
